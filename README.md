# NHEP - NeoHaskell Evolution Proposals

This repository will contain proposals for the [NeoHaskell](https://neohaskell.org) project, including draft design notes and discussions for in-progress proposals.

The implementation of the corresponding design enhancements usually lives in the [NeoHaskell Source Code Repository](https://github.com/neohaskell/neohaskell).

For a better overview of the design process and how to contribute. Visit [Evolution Proposals section of the NeoHaskell website](https://neohaskell.org/blog).
