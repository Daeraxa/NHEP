:::caution STATUS - DRAFT
:::

This NHEP will contain the index of all **NeoHaskell Enhancement Proposals**, known as NHEPs. NHEP numbers are assigned by the NHEP editors, and once assigned are never changed. The [Git history](https://github.com/neohaskell/NHEP) of the NHEP texts represent their historical record.

In the future, the NHEPs will be listed here by category. For now, use the sidebar on the left.

A good starting point is [NHEP 1](./0001-purpose-and-guidelines), which describes the NHEP process itself.
