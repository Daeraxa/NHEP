## Introduction

This document defines the target audience and [user persona](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persona_(user_experience)>) for the NeoHaskell project.

The definition of this target audience and user persona is intended to guide the design and development of the NeoHaskell project. It is not intended to be a strict definition of who can or cannot use the NeoHaskell project, only a guide to help the project team make decisions. Everyone is welcome to use the NeoHaskell, regardless of whether they fit the target audience or user persona.

## Target Audience

The target audience of NeoHaskell are developers who have a maker/hacker philosophy, and who are interested in developing a project as fast as possible in order to test an idea or prototype a product. They are not interested in spending a lot of time learning a new programming language in depth, they are not interested in learning software architecture in depth, and they are not interested in spending a lot of time learning a new framework.

They do have interest of learning new things, as long as those are steps in the direction of their goal. They are willing to learn a new programming language, as long as they can start writing code in a few hours. They are willing to learn a new framework, as long as they can start using it in a few hours. They are willing to learn a new architecture, as long as they can start using it in a few hours.

These are not interested in having a perfect code quality from the beginning, so they won't be investing time in thoroughly testing their code, regardless of the testing methodology. And although they do not know it, they value working in a domain driven way.

They will probably be interested in learning more about the programming language, the framework, and the architecture, but only after they have a working prototype of their project.

They don't have enough time to spend in their projects, probably because they have a full time job, or they are students, or they have a family, or they have other hobbies. So they prefer much a command line tool that does everything for them, instead of having to research the different tools for their technology stack, and then having to configure them to work together.

### Who's not the target audience

Well seasoned developers who have experience either in Haskell or in functional programming in general, and who are looking to apply concepts well established in the functional world.
